3. Google Doc - 1 vote /Music Sharer - 2 votes

# App Ideas

## Inspiration


1. Discord makes it really easy to find people available at the time
2. Spotify - shuffle functionality
3. Roll20 - lets you upload custom maps, drawings, ect...

## Health And Fitness

5. Fitness app that provides optimal workouts and meal plans. Take into account metrics about a persons body
6. App that lets you take pictures of food to estimate how many calories are in the meal

## Productivity

1. Google doc type replacement but allows users (engineers) to draw designs on their phone/tablet
2. Find a parking space during rush hour

## Social Networking/Lifestyle Apps

1. Scheduler to coordinate with friends to find places to eat together and make planning easier. Pull recipes based off of current groceries and based off of time that you currently have. What kind of person you are to try and match up with other people. Try to leverage facebook friends and twitter followers. Would need to look through your google calendar or hardcode your schedule.  
2. Music sharing app that lets people in your contact list listen to the same music as you at the same time
3. Outfit app that lets you mix and match current clothing items that you have to see how they would look. Can also let friends mix and match clothes for you to give you some suggestions. Outfit shuffler like spotify.

# Coordinate With Friends!

Scheduler to coordinate with friends to find places to eat together and coordinate when they can meetup. Many pratical applications including business and consumer.

1. Pull recipes based off of current groceries and based off of time that you currently have.
2. What kind of person you are to try and match up with other similar people.
3. Try to leverage facebook friends and twitter followers.
4. Requires looking through google calendar
5. Recommend places to eat based on the users food preferences

## Possible Caveats

1. A calendar to be lined up is required for most of the functionality (can be optional, but a user can input their preferences still. Automate when we can, but still let the user put in required information)
1. The number of features that we are wanting to implement 

## Priorities

1. Given a time and places that people like, randomly pick people for a good time
1. Make hosting events smooth; polling friends to see who will make it, what is on the agenda, what a friend needs to bring for the party
1. Host events and make sure everything is coordinated effictivly; establish a hierarchy; managers and executives are communicating with their employees in an effective way
