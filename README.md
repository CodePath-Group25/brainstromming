## SWIF

### App Description
Allows friends and family to see what each others schedules are like so that they can meetup for fun times. Friends and family can setup dates to meet at specific places and others can suggest something fun to do. This will sync everyone onto the same page without needing to use different apps (like facebook, google, or hangouts). 

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: maps, location, real-time, calendar, google restaurants reviews/ratings
- Story: Sense of community to encourage friends and families to go out. Brings people together to enjoy their lives. Makes it easier it actually have a fun time with friends and families.
- Market: Only limited to people of 18 years or older to try and discourage minors from meeting up to do illegal activities.
- Habit: Depends on what users are looking to do that day. Professionals could potentially use it on a daily basis to decide where to go for food. Friends and families may only use it once or twice a week for going out.
- Scope: Version 1 would be just syncing up calendars with friends. Version 2 would allow users to actually communicate in real time with people who they've shared their calendars with. Version 3 would levarage the location, maps, real-time, and google restaurants ideas, where they can view ratings for places where they can go eat, or places where they can do something fun ect...
